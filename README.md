# Hello-world
just open a new repository

Hello,humans!
It's the first time for me to write code
I think it's amazing.
I know this is difficult, but I just want to have a try.


So, here we go.
It's amazing to see that two years ago I written these words.  
And this time I am going to study how to use GitHub skillfully without intermittment.
